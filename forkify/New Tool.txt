Note: Tooling Changes
??PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU MOVE ON!  ??

Modern tools like Webpack and Babel change all the time, which is great for the development community, but difficult for course creators.

So please understand that I cannot re-record these videos each time a new change is introduced to one of the tools. Instead, I will keep this lecture updated with instructions to make your tooling setup work as it should.

There are two ways of approaching this: you either just want tools to work like in the videos, or you want to use the latest versions of the tools. Choose the one that works best ??



1. If you just want it to work, follow this (RECOMMENDED) ??

Tools don't add that much functionality in new versions, so you're just fine using this method.

You will have to install the same package versions that I install in my videos. So instead of the npm install commands I use in the videos, use the following (we use @ to specify the version number)

For webpack:

npm install --save-dev webpack@4 webpack-cli@2 webpack-dev-server@3
For babel:

npm install --save-dev babel-core@6 babel-preset-env@1 babel-loader@7
npm install --save babel-polyfill@6


2. If you want the latest versions, follow this ??

This method requires a little more work, as babel has recently changed how the configuration works.

For webpack, just follow the videos.

For babel, instead of installing babel-core, babel-preset-env and babel-polyfill in the babel lecture, please install @babel/core, @babel/preset-env, core-js@3, and regenerator-runtime like this:



npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader npm install --save core-js@3 regenerator-runtime



You will also need to change the entry in webpack.config.js (a file we create during the video) from this:

entry: ['babel-polyfill', './src/js/index.js'],
to this:

entry: ['./src/js/index.js'],
and the code in .babelrc (also created during the video) from this:

{
    "presets": [
        ["env", {
            "targets": {
                "browsers": [
                    "last 5 versions",
                    "ie >= 8"
                ]
            }
        }]
    ]
}
to this:

{
    "presets": [
        ["@babel/env", {
            "useBuiltIns": "usage",
            "corejs": "3",
            "targets": {
                "browsers": [
                    "last 5 versions",
                    "ie >= 8"
                ]
            }
        }]
    ]
}
