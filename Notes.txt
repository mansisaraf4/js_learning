Math.abs();

ES6 vs ES5
Let - Used to declare a variable //Can update value
Const = Used to declare a constant
Let and const are block scoped unlike var which is function scope
ES5
If we use var before it is defined it printed undefined
ES6
If we print a let before it is defined it gives error
In ES6 IIFE can directly be made as the vars are block  scoped
In ES6 we can use template literal using back ticks "`"
